# Transformer-Language-Model-in-PyTorch
This project implements a Transformer-based character-level language model using PyTorch. The model predicts and generates text sequences using self-attention mechanisms.

# Features
Character-level language model based on Transformer architecture.
Multi-head self-attention for capturing long-range dependencies.
Text generation based on trained patterns.
Evaluates training and validation loss periodically.
Customizable model hyperparameters for experimentation.

# Requirements
Python 3.7+
PyTorch
CUDA (optional, if using a GPU)

# Customization
Replace input.txt with your text data.
Adjust hyperparameters for different architectures and learning schedules.
Change max_new_tokens to control generated text length.
