# Transformer-Language-Model-in-PyTorch
This project implements a Transformer-based character-level language model using PyTorch. The model predicts and generates text sequences using self-attention mechanisms.

#Features
Character-level language model based on Transformer architecture.
Multi-head self-attention for capturing long-range dependencies.
Text generation based on trained patterns.
Evaluates training and validation loss periodically.
Customizable model hyperparameters for experimentation.
#Requirements
Python 3.7+
PyTorch
CUDA (optional, if using a GPU)
